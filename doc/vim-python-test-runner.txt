1. Intro                                                    *test-runner-intro*

A simple way of running tests for your python files from within VIM.

This plugin was created to allow running your regular python unit tests with 
nosetests.

===============================================================================
2. Requirements                                      *test-runner-requirements*

You need a VIM version that was compiled with python support, which is typical
for most distributions on Linux/Mac.  You can check this by running
``vim --version | grep +python``
if you get a hit you are in business.

Tests are ran with nosetest so this will need to be pip installed in order for
the plugin to function properly.

===============================================================================
3. Usage                                                    *test-runner-usage*

The plugin provides five commands:

- `NosetestFile`: Run all tests for the current file
- `NosetestClass`: Run all tests in the current class
- `NosetestMethod`: Run the current test method (inside of a class)
- `NosetestBaseMethod`: Run the current test method (outside of a class)
- `RerunLastTests`: Rerun the last tests

All arguments can be tab-completed. Ensure that your cursor is within a
file, class or method as appropriate for the command being called.

For ease of usage you can map the above actions to a shortcut. For example,
if you wanted leader mappings you could set something like the following in
your vimrc:

    nnoremap<Leader>nf :NosetestFile<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nc :NosetestClass<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nm :NosetestMethod<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>nb :NosetestBaseMethod<CR>
    nnoremap<Leader>rr :RerunLastTests<CR>

Your tests results will be available in the quickfix window after they finish
running and you return to your Vim buffer. Open quickfix with `:copen` and
you can jump to failing tests by placing your cursor on the desired test and
pressing enter.
